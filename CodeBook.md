Code Book
This code book describes the dataset and transformations applied to the raw data from the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project, obtained from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Source Data
The original data is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Source: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
Variables
Raw Data Files
features.txt: List of all features (561 features).
activity_labels.txt: Links the activity code with descriptive activity names.
train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels (activity codes).
train/subject_train.txt: Subjects for training data (each individual is identified by an ID).
test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels (activity codes).
test/subject_test.txt: Subjects for test data.
Variables in the Final Tidy Dataset
After cleaning and organizing, the final dataset includes the following variables:

subject: An integer identifier for each subject in the study.
activity: A factor indicating the activity performed (e.g., "WALKING," "SITTING").
Measurement Variables: Each variable represents the mean or standard deviation of measurements from the smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Only variables containing "mean()" or "std()" in the original dataset are retained, giving us 66 measurement variables.
Transformations and Cleaning Steps
Merging Data: Training and test datasets are combined to create a single dataset.
Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements: Only columns with "mean()" or "std()" in their names are selected.
Labeling Activities: Activity codes are replaced with descriptive activity names for clarity.
Descriptive Variable Names: Variable names are cleaned to remove special characters, ensuring readability.
Creating a Tidy Dataset: The data is grouped by subject and activity, and the mean of each variable is calculated to produce a final tidy dataset where each row is unique to a combination of subject and activity.
